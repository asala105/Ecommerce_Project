# Ecommerce Project
In this project I implemented an e-commerce website where sellers 
and buyers can login and interact with each other. 

- Sellers:
  -Ability to signup and login
  -Ability to add new products 
  -Ability to remove products
  -Ability to edit products
  -Ability to check the monthly revenue
- Buyers:
  -Ability to signup and login
  -Ability to browse products 
  -Ability to buy any product (without checkout)
  -Ability to click on a product to see details (single product page)
